🎬 Movie Guessing Game (C Project)

A simple C-based movie guessing game, similar to Hangman, where the program selects a random Bollywood movie title, masks it with underscores, and the user must guess letters within a limited number of attempts.

The game validates input (A–Z only), tracks used letters, reveals correct guesses, and ends when the player either guesses the movie or runs out of attempts.
