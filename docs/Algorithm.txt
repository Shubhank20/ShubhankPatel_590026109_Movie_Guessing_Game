Algorithm for Movie Guessing Game
Start program.
Load the list of movie names into an array.
Generate a random number and select a movie from the list.
Calculate movie length and create a masked version of the movie (replace all letters with _).
Initialize game state:
attempts = MAX_ATTEMPTS
guessed_letters array = all false
game_over = false
Start game loop (repeat until win or loss):
Display current game status:
masked movie
attempts left
used letters
Check if masked movie matches the original movie:
If yes → display win message → exit loop
Check if attempts = 0:
If yes → display loss message and reveal movie → exit loop
Ask the user to enter a letter (A–Z).
Validate the input:
Must be a single character
Must be alphabetic
Convert to uppercase
Check if the letter was already guessed:
If yes → display warning → go to next iteration
Mark the letter as guessed in the guessed_letters array.
Check if the guessed letter exists in the secret movie:
If found → reveal the letter in all positions in masked_word
If not found → decrease attempts by 1
Repeat loop until win or lose.
End program.
